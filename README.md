__Title: Object Oriented approach In Javascript__


__Program Description:__

*** All the examples are explained in the slides. This github repository only provides the code for those examples in case you want to run them. ***

There are two directories in this repo. "ES5" containes object-oriented examples in JS ES5 and "ES6" containes object-oriented examples in JS ES6.


__HOW TO RUN:__

In general, the easiest way to run Javascript code is to copy the code in the console of your browser, and then press run.

*** to access to your browser console, click right on the browser screen and then choose "inspect element" and then select the "console" tab. ***

__HOW TO RUN CODE AND TESTS PROVIDED IN THE ES6 FOLDER__

The other way to run the code in ES6 folder: There is an index.html file in that folder which contains a script tag that refers to a js script file. 

You can change the src = "..." to refer to different js files included in the ES6 directory. 

Then you can simply open the index.html file in the browser and look at the browser's console (the instruction of openning console provided in the previous section) to see the results of the JavaScript code and tests.
